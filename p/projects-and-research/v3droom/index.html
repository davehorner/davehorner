    <h1>v3droom</h1>
   <br/>

v3droom will be an open source collaboration and visualization framework.  It provides softphone capabilities as well as IVR. It consists of source code, documentation, applications, scripts, and installers for multiple OSs.   which provide the needed components.
<br/>
I will be exposing functionality from many open source libraries, like: python, Ogre3d,  freeswitch, libapr, OpenCV, ARToolkit, and more.<br/>
<br/>
I will be developing apis within python which  provide extreme extensibility.  Change runtime behavior with a simple python script.  Go python!
<br/>
<br/>
At this time, my company TecDev is providing all support and funding for development of v3droom programming and packaging.<br/>
If you find v3droom useful.  Please consider supporting the project in some way.<br/>
All code contributions, feature requests, questions & comments, etc. are greatly appreciated.  Thank you for your support.

<hr class="system-pagebreak" />
<p>This project explores the development of a multi-modal(voice,dtmf,keyboard,mouse) human computer interface (HCI) to allow for increased usability within traditional telephony applications.<br /><br /> Providing an interactive visual interface over top of traditional telephony applications allows for increased accessability. This system would allow users to nagivate interactive voice response(IVR) systems with ease because they are able to travel in a non-linear fashion. Instead of having to listen to available options one at a time, the user can interact with a visual represention of the IVR.<br /> <br /> The addition of visual elements within a telephony system provides capabilities which would not have been previously available to a traditional telephony application.<br /> <br /> The hardware and network level services for such a system have been around for quite some time. However, there isn't currently a platform independent way of interacting with people in 3d space while using the computer(keyboard, mouse, etc.) and telephone(speech+dtmf).<br /> <br /> Today touchtone phones are ubiquitous and many models include high resolution touch sensitive screens. Phone interaction should not simply be a audiable experience. Future communication systems will provide an imersive platform which incorporate both the visual and audible senses.&nbsp; The syncronization of visual display elements to process workflow will allow for better understanding of the system as a whole.<br /> <br /> Phone clients describe the contents of the each virtually simulated world and provide a mechanism to query and manipulate objects within the world.<br /> <br /> Computer Initial world will expose a simple graphical model which can be rotated by each of the computer/phone players. Each player can be connected via the phone and/or computer.<br /> <br /> <strong>Process Flow</strong><br /> <br />  1. User triggers action on cell.<br /> 2. Cell sends command to PC.<br /> 3. PC updates the VSM -&gt; viewable<br /> 4. PC sends acknowledgement to cell.<br /> </p><p><strong>What will become of virtual telephony world?</strong><br />Ultimately this program is just something to help me demonstrate to myself that I can do something by connecting peices together.&nbsp; I see this system is more of a scientific nature.&nbsp; When I look at it, I immediately see math.&nbsp; I would dream of a system like this for physical modeling and mathematics in general.&nbsp; I look at it much like a stream processor.&nbsp; I can write visualizations of any kind of data in realtime or near-realtime.&nbsp; That means a lot.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>visual stream processors.<br /><br /><strong>Download</strong><br />The prototype for this system is developed on the windows platform but additional platform support will be added later.&nbsp; To get going, download and follow the on screen instructions during the installation.<br /> <br />The current version is: v1.0.0.2<br />Release Date: April 06, 2007<br />

<hr class="system-pagebreak" /><br />This page describes some of the research that I've been doing while trying to decide on how to implement this project.&nbsp; You would not believe how much time I've spent reading various articles relating to different 3d toolkits, network apis, telephony platforms, etc.&nbsp; There are many things to think about when trying to develop network games...adding a telephony component makes it all the more complex.<br /></p><p> Network server management is based on the <a href="http://www.rakkarsoft.com/raknet/manual/distributednetworkobject.html">RakNet::DistributedNetworkObjectManager</a><br /> <br /> Here are some web references for material I read from:<br /> <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/internet/multiplayer.asp?select=1250973&amp;df=100&amp;forumid=223184&amp;exp=0">Building Multiplayer Capability into Your Game in One Hour</a><br /> <br />This project will make use of the following libraries and software packages:<br /> <a href="http://www.rakkarsoft.com/">RakNet</a> - cross platform C++ network library designed to allow programmers to add response time-critical network capabilities to their applications<br /> <a href="http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/">Irrlicht Engine</a> - high performance realtime 3D engine written in cross-platform C++, using D3D, OpenGL and its own software renderer.<br />  Webserver <a href="http://www.apache.org">Apache</a> - webserver<br /> <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a> - scripting language<br /> <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/voicexml20/">VXML</a> - VoiceXML, the Voice Extensible Markup Language<br />  </p><p><strong>Building the server</strong><br /> <pre>  <br /><br /> <strong>Further </strong><strong>network research</strong><br /> Trying to syncronize state across multiple clients is not a simple task.&nbsp; There are many choices to be made in terms of network protocals, implmentation language, class design, etc.&nbsp; In a sense what I'm looking for is grid computing network services.&nbsp; I'd like to be able to develop a data model and have it syncronize across all the nodes in the network.&nbsp; I would like to explore other libraries to allow for realtime distributed simulations. Specifically I would like to research publish/subscribe network object syncronization.<br /> <a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE.html">The ADAPTIVE Communication Environment</a><br /> <a href="http://msi.sourceforge.net/">Multi-Simulation Interface</a><br /> <a href="http://www.lcscanada.com/muscle/">Multi User Server Client Linkage Environment v3.30</a><br /> <a href="http://www-serl.cs.colorado.edu/serl/siena/contrib/index.html">Siena (Scalable Internet Event Notification Architecture)</a><br /> <br /> <br /> So the idea keeps coming to me that we shouldn't even require an OpenGL platform. We should be able to do this using open standards like HTML and CSS. CSS provides ways of positioning items in 2d with a z-index. Shouldn't people be able to access the world in 2d too?<br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.brothercake.com/site/resources/reference/3d/">Dynamic 3D with CSS and the DOM</a><br /> <a href="http://tantek.com/CSS/Examples/polygons.html">A Study of Regular Polygons using CSS</a><br /> <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/article/accessible-javascript">Accessible JavaScript: Beyond the Mouse</a><br /> <a href="http://24ways.org/2006/showing-good-form">24 ways to impress your friends  :Showing Good Form</a><br /> <a href="http://ajaxworldmagazine.com/read/333329.htm">How and Why AJAX, Not Java, Became the Favored Technology for RIAs</a><br /> <br /><br /> <strong>VRML and X3D<br /></strong> VRML has been around for a long time now.&nbsp; I remember playing with it when I was in high school.&nbsp; It is a &quot;simple&quot; markup language to describe 3d worlds.<br />  </p><p>X3D is a newer open XML standard for 3D content delivery.
