In <strong>1873</strong>, British mathematician William Shanks stunned the world of mathematics when he claimed to have calculated pi to <strong>707</strong> digits. In <strong>1945</strong>, D.F. Ferguson, <strong>using pen and paper</strong>, identified an error |?????&#03C0 8; in Shanks' work in the <strong>527th place</strong>. Ferguson then carried the computation to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_TR-808">808</a> places.<br/>
</br>
In <strong>1948</strong>, Wrench and Smith verified Ferguson's work—and continued the calculation to <strong>1,000</strong> places <strong>using a gear-driven calculator</strong>. In 1961, Wrench and Daniel Shanks (unrelated to William Shanks) used an <strong>IBM 7090</strong> to calculate pi to <strong>100,265</strong> digits. The printout was formally presented to the Smithsonian Institution—and their feat earned a place in the Guinness Book of Records.
<a href="https://www.maa.org/news/math-news/pi-computation-wizard-john-wrench-dies-at-age-97">Pi Computation Wizard John Wrench Dies at Age 97 | Mathematical Association of America</a> - Few today remember what mathematician John William Wrench Jr. did 60 years ago, just before the advent of the electronic computer. He and fellow mathematician Levi Smith calculated the value of pi to more than <strong>1,000</strong> decimal places.  (a lil more flare and he might have submitted 2 pow 10, 2^10, 1024!)<br/>

pi is found everywhere;  an elusive infinite number.  pi is a number which works|sings sweetly with however much precision you require; time, space, circles, and random noise.<br/>
zoom out and rotate your head however you like to see the spiral.  we all follow implicitly; its in there.<br/>
it has a shape.  a diameter and circumference.  it has a name.  it teases it's <strong>universality</strong>.  concrete infinite.  circle of pie.<br/>
just select a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_Hough_Transform">circle Hough Transform (CHT)</a> local maxima in an accumulator matrix.<br/>
we may not all see the same color &lt;span style="color:<span style="color:blue">blue</span>"&gt;; yours and mine being equal in complex polar coordinates or otherwise.  circles, have a smell | poetry.  we all see the pie piece and imagine the pie hole.<br/>

pi sometimes feels too good to be true.  just square the circle.  or was it, circle the square?  pls provide the ghost solution to the penrose tiling?

my son Gabe 10/10/2020 asked me today; what's the biggest number you know of.  best I could do was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googleplex">googleplex</a> for a name.  when asked what it was; all I could say was a lot of 9's plus 1.<br/>
<br/>
A googolplex is the number 10googol, or equivalently, 10(10100). Written out in ordinary decimal notation, it is 1 followed by 10100 zeroes, that is, a 1 followed by a googol zeroes.  
<br/>
<br/>
This still is the largest number I can name off the top of my head.  correct and accurate big numbers are hard.  if I looked; I bet there's at least + 1 bigger yet.  i still have to ask why?  what's important about the next 1024 precise digits of pie?  who cares?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>2019/March</strong> we celebrated the most accurate value of pi calculated <strong>31,415,926,535,897</strong> digits of pi.<br/>
<br/>
when do we get a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googleplex">googleplex</a> of pi digits?  does it/is matter?  who cares if they calculated pi &amp;pi &pi; digits of &pi;.  <strong>3.14 is enough most times.</strong>  <strong>c. 250 BCE Archimedes</strong> bound pie up	(?223?71 < ? < ?22?7) || (223&frasl;71 &lt; &pi; &lt; ?22&frasl;7)  how many places/digits of &pi; does your app need?  what's the resolution and precision needed for your confidence level at what goal?  when does our &pi; constant error in the <strong>527th place</strong> begin to matter||show in our solution?<br/>  
<br/>
<br/>
finding &pi;pie&pi; with precision takes time and resources; writing known digits of pi is easy to write; calculating digits of pi and verification is NP-Hard.  When does the 50,000,000,000,000th place of pi matter?; <br/>

<br/>
according to wikipedia: book can be printed with 106 zeros (around 400 pages with 50 lines per page and 50 zeros per line) therefore, it requires 10^(94) such books to print all the zeros of a googolplex (that is, printing a googol zeros). If each book had a mass of 100 grams;  the mass of all such books required to write out a googolplex would be vastly greater than the masses of the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxies combined (by a factor of roughly 2.0 x 1050), and <strong>greater than the mass of the observable universe by a factor of roughly 7 x 1039.</strong>.  that's a lot of zeros. 
 but who carries around books these days?!  why print and write such a number to paper?  what's that for dude?<br/>
<br/>
I guess my son will have to forgive me for the 9's and 1 joke.  Did I mention he just turned 9?  It's the best explanation I had at the time.<br/>

want is 1+1 11 or 2 but it kan be 4 bekus my name is poop on xbox you can add me on xbox

to circle back to my boy in the car yesterday: I didn't realize at the time;  it is 1 + (10100-1) 9's. a one zero goo gol. a 10googol;<br/>
<br/>
I wonder how long it will take to get the goo gle of pi.  Jan-2020 Gabe and I still working on phonics and we've only got 13 9's pi + 1 * 50 today;  that took us almost a year to compute <strong>we(a|e)k</strong> computers (303 days!). wonder what places they'll see 314 days in 2020.  someone's working on it; from many perspectives.<br/>
<br/>
nine year olds usually don't get order of operations and parentheses!  it takes time.  we all have our tricks.  <strong>tell/ask me 1+1; I just need to know what's 1 * 1 first?</strong><br/>
<strong>29 January 2020</strong> using y-cruncher v0.7.7 303 days <strong>50,000,000,000,000</strong> decimal places.<br/>
