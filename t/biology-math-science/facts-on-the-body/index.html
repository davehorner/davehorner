    <h1>Facts on the human body</h1>
   I love facts on the human body because we really are amazing machines.  Many times I sit and think about how simple our technology is today.  When I compare technology today with the human body, it makes me think <a href="http://dave.thehorners.com/tech-talk/science-and-math/206-math-you-gotta-love-vectors">abacus and slide rule</a>.<br/>
<ul>

	<li>An average human scalp has 100,000 hairs.</li>
	<li>The length of the finger dictates how fast the fingernail grows. Therefore, the nail on your middle finger grows the fastest, and on average, your toenails grow twice as slow as your fingernails.</li>
	<li>The average human blinks their eyes 6,205,000 times each year.</li>
	<li>The entire length of all the eyelashes shed by a human in their life is over 98 feet (30 m).</li>
	<li>Your skull is made up of 29 different bones.</li>
	<li>Your ears and nose continue to grow throughout your entire life.</li>
	<li>The average surface of the human intestine is 656 square feet (200 m).</li>
	<li>A healthy adult can draw in about 200 to 300 cubic inches (3.3 to 4.9 liters) of air at a single breath, but at rest only about 5% of this volume is used.</li>
	<li>The surface of the human skin is 6.5 square feet (2m).</li>
	<li>15 million blood cells are destroyed in the human body every second.</li>
	<li>The pancreas produces Insulin.</li>
	<li>The most sensitive cluster of nerves is at the base of the spine.</li>
	<li>The human body is comprised of 80% water.</li>
	<li>The average human will shed 40 pounds of skin in a lifetime.</li>
	<li>Every year about 98% of the atoms in your body are replaced.</li>
	<li>The human heart creates enough pressure to squirt blood 30 feet (9 m).</li>
	<li>You were born with 300 bones. When you get to be an adult, you have 206.</li>
	<li>Human thighbones are stronger than concrete.</li>
	<li>Every human spent about half an hour as a single cell.</li>
	<li>There are 45 miles (72 km) of nerves in the skin of a human being.</li>
	<li>The average human heart will beat 3,000 million times in its lifetime and pump 48 million gallons of blood.</li>
	<li>Each square inch (2.5 cm) of human skin consists of 20 feet (6 m) of blood vessels.</li>
	<li>During a 24-hour period, the average human will breathe 23,040 times.</li>
	<li>Human blood travels 60,000 miles (96,540 km) per day on its journey through the body.</li>
	<li>The average brain uses the equivalent of 20 watts of power</li>
	<li>The average power consumption of a typical adult is about 100 Watt - "Body, Physics of." Macmillan Encyclopedia of Physics. New York: Macmillan, 1996.</li>

Answering questions such as 'What is the role and purpose of life and consciousness within the context of the greater reality of the universe?' Yet there also exists a separate but growing scientific movement for studying consciousness alone in its many different unique aspects, while the main thrust of physical consciousness studies is to find the neural correlates of consciousness. At this level of scientific inquiry physics is used to model consciousness as a 'thing' separate from the material brain but somehow dependent on the brain. In other words, physics is not only used to study the observable external world represented by the material universe (including the material body and brain), but also the internal world created by mind and consciousness that is interpreting our individual observations of the external material world. This dichotomy between the internal and external world of consciousness represents the central problem of neurocosmology.<br/>

it seems obvious we need to have a body to have a physical brain and mind.  but not so obvious that the same physical brain manifests a/many disembodied mind(s) which communicate and interact with other physical cognitive minds.  technology provides humanity's physical mind with the ability to type/communicate words/thoughts once, but many machines/minds consume it ad infinitum, or until sometime breaks...<br/>
