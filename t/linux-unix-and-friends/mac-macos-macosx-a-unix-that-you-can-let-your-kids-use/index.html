    <h1>Mac / MacOS / MacOSX - A Unix that you can let your kids use.</h1>
   So it has been awhile since I last used a Apple.  In fact, some of the last times I remember being on a mac involved developing hypercard stacks for my elementary school.  Hypercards were pre-html html, you had a set of cards, and you linked them together with scripting, displayed images and text, etc.
It was pretty amazing stuff back in the day.  This was on the Machintosh.  You know, after the Apple IIe.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, enough history.<br/>
<br/>
I just bought a new iMac 20" Intel dual core.  oy am I happy.  I've been away for so long!  Now the OS is based on bsd so I feel right at home.<br/>
<br/>
The thing that attracts me most to the new macs is that they can run all the great software I've been using on my Linux and Unix machines over the years. gcc,makefiles,grep,ssh,wget,etc,etc<br/>
<br/>

<h2>PDF printer on the mac.</h2>

<h2>Setup network sharing with Bonjour</h2>
Have you ever needed to get to a machine that you know is on the same local network but don't know its IP?  Bonjour allows you to find computers by name on your network without having to look it up or setup DNS.  Instead, just add .local to your hostname and you are set!  Very neat.<br/>
<br/>
About Bonjour
Bonjour, also known as zero-configuration networking, enables automatic discovery of computers, devices, and services on IP networks. Bonjour uses industry standard IP protocols to allow devices to automatically discover each other without the need to enter IP addresses or configure DNS servers.<br/>
<br/>
"Bonjour is a networking protocol that sends and receives network packets on UDP port 5353. If you have a firewall enabled, you will need to ensure that UDP port 5353 is open for Bonjour to work correctly. Certain firewalls will only partially block Bonjour packets, so if you experience intermittent behavior, check the firewall settings and verify that Bonjour is listed as an exception and is allowed to receive incoming packets. Bonjour will configure the Windows firewall appropriately during installation on Windows XP Service Pack 2 and above." -- [<a href="http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/bonjourforwindows103.html" target="_blank">Bonjour for Windows 1.0.3</a>]<br/>
<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/onlamp/blog/2006/01/bonjour_for_windows.html">Bonjour for Windows - O'Reilly ONLamp Blog</a><br/>
<br/>
Developers can download the Bonjour SDK to add Bonjour technology to their applications.  For more information about developing products that use Bonjour, and to download the SDK, please visit <http://developer.apple.com/bonjour/>.<br/>

I know this seems like a silly thing to be annoyed about...but some keys don't work the same on the Mac as they do on Win machines.  For instance, "home" and "end" keys on Win machines move you to the start and end of your current textbox.  On the Mac, "home" and "end" are used to scroll you to the top and bottom of your current document.  (this can be really annoying if you are trying to select all the text in your textbox by holding "shift" and hitting "home").<br/>
<br/>
The solution to this is to use "Apple-A" to select all the text, then hit the left arrow.  Or you can use the Win equivalent "Apple-Leftarrow" and "Apple-Rightarrow" to move "home" and "end" respectively.<br/>
<br/>
It is funny what can annoy you when switching to a new platform.<br/>
<br/>

<h2>Help, my mac mouse won't work</h2>
Could be that you have Mouse Keys enabled.  To disable hit the "Option" key five times to toggle Mouse Keys<br/>

<h2>File sharing with windows</h2>
First off you need to turn sharing on by doing the following
<ol>
  <li>Open System Preferences and click Sharing and, if necessary, click Services.</li>
  <li>Select Windows Sharing in the list, then click Start.</li>
  <li>Click Accounts and select the name of the user account that will share files. Enter the password for that user.</li>
  <li>Look below the services list for your computer's network address. Give this address to Windows users.</li>
</ol>
The above will allow other windows machines to access your mac home directory.  If you'd like to setup sharing of volumes and other folders, do the following:<br/>

<h2>FINK - More unix like ENV for MacOS using fink</h2>
<a href="http://www.finkproject.org/index.php">Fink</a> is a project that brings tools like dselect and apt-get to Darwin and MacOS X.<br/>
<br/>
If you know how to use dselect or apt-get, then you'll know how to use fink.<br/>
<br/>
All the software packages that fink installs goes into the /sw/ directory.  If you need to uninstall simply:<br/>
<pre>
rm -rf /sw/
</pre>
<br/>
To setup fink to install unstable packages, you need to add "unstable/main" and "unstable/crypto" to the "Trees:" line.<br/>
This what what my line looks like:<br/>
Trees: local/main stable/main stable/crypto unstable/main unstable/crypto<br/>
<pre>
vi /sw/etc/fink.conf;
fink selfupdate; fink index; fink scanpackages
</pre>
You can also just run "fink configure", which will ask you a question to add unstable.<br/>
<br/>
To list the files installed by a package use dpkg.
<pre>
dpkg -L packagename
</pre>

<h2>Upgrading autoconf and automake on MacOSX</h2>
For some reason, Mac OS X 10.4.9 distributed with autoconf 2.59, automake 1.6.3.  I was surprised to see that the old versions were included...autoconf/automake had better versions available at the time of packaging for MacOSX 10.4.  At least fink makes it easy to upgrade these nice tools.  I wouldn't try downloading and installing the packages from source.  I've made that mistake.
<br/>
<pre>
% fink selfupdate
(update package descriptions, re-index)
% fink install automake1.9
(gets you automake 1.9.6)
% fink install libtool14
(gets you GNU libtool 1.5.22)
% fink install autoconf
(gets you autoconf 2.60)

<h2>add paths to environment in macosx</h2>
There is a file /etc/paths which is a fine place to add new global paths.  Additionally there is /etc/paths.d/ which is just like /etc/paths but you add single files which are added to the env.<br/>
Another option is ~/.profile || ~/.bash_profile (user specific) or /etc/profile (global) by using export. these of course affect the shell/terminal<br/>

<h2>Copy path to clipboard</h2>
On windows, I've found a shell extension which allows you to select a file(s) and copy the full path to the clipboard.  This comes in handy all the time for developers as we are working with files all the time.<br/>
So now, off to find a way to do it in mac...<br/>
Drag the file into Terminal and it automatically puts the path in your Terminal window.<br/>

<h2>Apple Trackpad - Magic Trackpad - unpair from device - trackpad reset</h2>
I am a fan of the Magic Trackpad, but for all the intuitive user oriented design Apple puts into products; pairing and unpairing isn't straight forward.  But I have to say that pretty much every keyboard or mouse is similarly unclear about how to unpair...pair information should be printed on the device. including default pin. If you cared, maybe some braille.<br/>
<br/>
I myself, like unnatural scrolling with the trackpad. To each his own;I guess up=up&amp;down=down is !Natural.<br/>
Ctrl-Click is right click, of course. Two finger tap is right click on Magic Trackpad by default... easy enough to use sys prefs to configure other "Secondary tap"s for 3 and 4 finger tapping magic.<br/>
<br/>
magic trackpad unpair from device<br/>
1. Hold down the power button on the Magic Trackpad for 5 seconds until it turns off.<br/>
2. Hold down the power button on the Magic Trackpad for another 5 seconds until the light starts flashing... <strong>KEEP THE BUTTON HELD DOWN WHILE YOU TRY TO PAIR</strong>. The button hold will prevent the Magic Trackpad from pairing with the prior device.  Apparently even if you have unpaired the device from the original prior to initiating pairing; hold down the button on the track pad while you complete the pairing.<br/>

make sure you have some good batteries!<br/>

<h2>magic mouse expose</h2>
the magic mouse is pretty magic;  but it doesn't include gesture support for expose like the touch pad does.  which is sad, because three finger up is much better than using hot corners...
<a href="http://magicprefs.com/">MagicPrefs</a> - provides the awesome three finger up gesture for "Mission Control"<br/>

<h2>Troublesome large display resolutions in macosx || get 2560x1080 in macosx</h2>
windows 8.1 will recognize my LG ULTRAWIDE 2560x1080 over HDMI.  I couldn't get this to work on my miniMac.  Instead I bought a mini-dp to dp cable and that still didn't seem to like the max resolution of 2560x1080 instead it gave me something like 2560x864 which isn't fun.  So I sent searching...people talking about using SwitchResX, but I really didn't want to have to run that to make my monitor work.  I found some people were having success with forcing profiles on the monitor, apparently macOS is prone to mis-associating large screens with tv output...  running ruby <a href="https://gist.github.com/adaugherity/7435890">patch-edid.rb</a> and moving the needed profile into the /System/Library/Displays/Overrides; reboot;   It's says "force RGB mode (EDID override)" now in System Preferences-&gt;Displays. now working! (wonder if I needed that special DP cable after all!)<br/>

<a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4672999?tstart=0">How to display 2560x1080 on external monitor fr... | Apple Support Communities</a><br/>
i did find that I had to redo the process when upgrading to OSX Yosemite. I found that I needed to actually manually delete the override and copy the override using finder. (doing a sudo cp did not work after multiple attempts rebooting)  I did notice that the display showed override in the title before rebooting, and finally worked when it had done so.<br/>
/System/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides is the new location for Sierra.  csrutil disable to write to /System.<br/>
