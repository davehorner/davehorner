    <h1>Cron intro</h1>
   <u><strong>What is cron?<br />
</strong></u><br />
Cron is the name of program that enables unix users to execute commands or<br />
scripts (groups of commands) automatically at a specified time/date. It is<br />
normally used for sys admin commands, like <em>makewhatis</em>, which builds a<br />
search database for the <em>man -k</em> command, or for running a backup script, <br />
but can be used for anything. A common use for it today is connecting to <br />
the internet and downloading your email.<br />
<br />
<u><strong>Using cron<br />
</strong></u><br />
In the <em>/etc</em> directory you will probably find some sub directories called <br />
'<em>cron.hourly</em>', '<em>cron.daily</em>', '<em>cron.weekly</em>' and '<em>cron.monthly</em>'. If you place <br />
a script into one of those directories it will be run either hourly, daily, <br />
weekly or monthly, depending on the name of the directory. <br />
<br />
If you want more flexibility than this, you can edit a crontab (the name <br />
for cron's config files). The main config file is normally <em>/etc/crontab</em>.<br />
On a default RedHat install, the crontab will look something like this:<br />
<strong><br />
</strong>
<strong><br />
root@somehost # cat /etc/crontab</strong>
<strong><br />
SHELL=/bin/bash</strong>
<strong><br />
PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin</strong>
<strong><br />
MAILTO=root</strong>
<strong><br />
HOME=/</strong>
<strong><br />
</strong>
<strong><br />
# run-parts</strong>
<strong><br />
01 * * * * root run-parts /etc/cron.hourly</strong>
<strong><br />
02 4 * * * root run-parts /etc/cron.daily</strong>
<strong><br />
22 4 * * 0 root run-parts /etc/cron.weekly</strong>
<strong><br />
42 4 1 * * root run-parts /etc/cron.monthly</strong>
<strong><br />
</strong><br />
The first part is almost self explanatory; it sets the variables for cron.<br />
<br />
<em>SHELL</em> is the 'shell' cron runs under. If unspecified, it will default to <br />
the entry in the <em>/etc/passwd</em> file.<br />
<br />
<em>PATH</em> contains the directories which will be in the search path for cron <br />
e.g if you've got a program 'foo' in the directory /usr/cog/bin, it might <br />
be worth adding /usr/cog/bin to the path, as it will stop you having to use<br />
the full path to 'foo' every time you want to call it.<br />
<br />
<em>MAILTO</em> is who gets mailed the output of each command. If a command cron is <br />
running has output (e.g. status reports, or errors), cron will email the output <br />
to whoever is specified in this variable. If no one if specified, then the <br />
output will be mailed to the owner of the process that produced the output.<br />
<br />
<em>HOME</em> is the home directory that is used for cron. If unspecified, it will <br />
default to the entry in the <em>/etc/passwd</em> file.<br />
<br />
Now for the more complicated second part of a crontab file.<br />
An entry in cron is made up of a series of fields, much like the /etc/passwd<br />
file is, but in the crontab they are separated by a space. There are normally<br />
seven fields in one entry. The fields are:<br />
<strong><br />
minute hour dom month dow user cmd<br />
</strong><br />
<em>minute</em>	This controls what minute of the hour the command will run on,<br />
	 and is between '0' and '59'<br />
<br />
<em>hour</em>	This controls what hour the command will run on, and is specified in<br />
         the 24 hour clock, values must be between 0 and 23 (0 is midnight)<br />
<br />
<em>dom</em>	This is the Day of Month, that you want the command run on, e.g. to<br />
	 run a command on the 19th of each month, the dom would be 19.<br />
<br />
<em>month</em>	This is the month a specified command will run on, it may be specified<br />
	 numerically (0-12), or as the name of the month (e.g. May)<br />
<br />
<em>dow</em>	This is the Day of Week that you want a command to be run on, it can<br />
	 also be numeric (0-7) or as the name of the day (e.g. sun).<br />
<br />
<em>user</em>	This is the user who runs the command.<br />
<br />
<em>cmd</em>	This is the command that you want run. This field may contain <br />
	 multiple words or spaces.<br />
<br />
If you don't wish to specify a value for a field, just place a <em>*</em> in the <br />
field.<br />
<br />
e.g.<strong><br />
01 * * * * root echo &quot;This command is run at one min past every hour&quot;<br />
17 8 * * * root echo &quot;This command is run daily at 8:17 am&quot;<br />
17 20 * * * root echo &quot;This command is run daily at 8:17 pm&quot;<br />
00 4 * * 0 root echo &quot;This command is run at 4 am every Sunday&quot;<br />
* 4 * * Sun root echo &quot;So is this&quot;<br />
42 4 1 * * root echo &quot;This command is run 4:42 am every 1st of the month&quot;<br />
01 * 19 07 * root echo &quot;This command is run hourly on the 19th of July&quot;</strong><br />
<br />
Notes:<br />
Under dow 0 and 7 are both Sunday.<br />
<br />
If both the dom and dow are specified, the command will be executed when<br />
either of the events happen. <br />
e.g.<strong><br />
* 12 16 * Mon root cmd</strong><br />
Will run cmd at midday every Monday and every 16th, and will produce the <br />
same result as both of these entries put together would:<br />
<br />
<strong>* 12 16 * * root cmd<br />
* 12 * * Mon root cmd</strong><br />
Vixie Cron also accepts lists in the fields. Lists can be in the form, 1,2,3 <br />
(meaning 1 and 2 and 3) or 1-3 (also meaning 1 and 2 and 3).<br />
e.g.<br />
<strong>59 11 * * 1,2,3,4,5 root backup.sh</strong><br />
Will run backup.sh at 11:59 Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday,<br />
as will:<br />
<strong>59 11 * * 1-5 root backup.sh </strong><br />
<br />
Cron also supports 'step' values.<br />
A value of <em>*/2</em> in the dom field would mean the command runs every two days<br />
and likewise, <em>*/5</em> in the hours field would mean the command runs every <br />
5 hours.<br />
e.g. <br />
<strong>* 12 10-16/2 * * root backup.sh</strong><br />
is the same as:<br />
<strong>* 12 10,12,14,16 * * root backup.sh<br />
<br />
</strong>
<strong>*/15 9-17 * * * root connection.test</strong><br />
Will run connection.test every 15 mins between the hours or 9am and 5pm<br />
<br />
<br />
Lists can also be combined with each other, or with steps:<br />
<strong>* 12 1-15,17,20-25 * * root cmd</strong><br />
Will run cmd every midday between the 1st and the 15th as well as the 20th <br />
and 25th (inclusive) and also on the 17th of every month.<br />
<strong>* 12 10-16/2 * * root backup.sh</strong><br />
is the same as:<br />
<strong>* 12 10,12,14,16 * * root backup.sh</strong><br />
<br />
When using the names of weekdays or months, it isn't case sensitive, but only<br />
the first three letters should be used, e.g. Mon, sun or Mar, jul.<br />
Comments are allowed in crontabs, but they must be preceded with a '#', and<br />
must be on a line by them self.  <u><strong><br />
<br />
Multiuser cron</strong></u><br />
As Unix is a multiuser OS, some of the apps have to be able to support <br />
multiple users, cron is one of these. Each user can have their own crontab<br />
file, which can be created/edited/removed by the command <em>crontab</em>. This<br />
command creates an individual crontab file and although this is a text file,<br />
as the <em>/etc/crontab</em> is, it shouldn't be edited directly. The crontab file is<br />
often stored in <em>/var/spool/cron/crontabs/&lt;user&gt;</em> (Unix/Slackware/*BSD), <br />
<em>/var/spool/cron/&lt;user&gt;</em> (RedHat) or <em>/var/cron/tabs/&lt;user&gt;</em> (SuSE), <br />
but might be kept elsewhere depending on what Un*x flavor you're running.<br />
<br />
To edit (or create) your crontab file, use the command <em>crontab -e</em>, and this<br />
will load up the editor specified in the environment variables <em>EDITOR</em> or <br />
<em>VISUAL</em>, to change the editor invoked on Bourne-compliant shells, try: <br />
<strong>cog@</strong><strong>somehost</strong><strong> $ export EDITOR=vi</strong><br />
On C shells:<br />
<strong>cog@somehost $ setenv EDITOR vi</strong><br />
You can of course substitute vi for the text editor of your choice.<br />
Your own personal crontab follows exactly the same format as the main<br />
<em>/etc/crontab</em> file does, except that you need not specify the <em>MAILTO</em> <br />
variable, as this entry defaults to the process owner, so you would be mailed<br />
the output anyway, but if you so wish, this variable can be specified.<br />
You also need not have the user field in the crontab entries. e.g.<br />
<strong><br />
min hr dom month dow cmd</strong><br />
Once you have written your crontab file, and exited the editor, then it will<br />
check the syntax of the file, and give you a chance to fix any errors.<br />
If you want to write your crontab without using the crontab command, you can<br />
write it in a normal text file, using your editor of choice, and then use the<br />
crontab command to replace your current crontab with the file you just wrote.<br />
e.g. if you wrote a crontab called cogs.cron.file, you would use the cmd<strong><br />
<br />
cog@</strong><strong>somehost</strong><strong> $ crontab cogs.cron.file</strong><br />
to replace your existing crontab with the one in cogs.cron.file.<br />
You can use <strong><br />
cog@</strong><strong>somehost</strong><strong> $ crontab -l </strong><br />
to list your current crontab, and<strong><br />
<br />
cog@</strong><strong>somehost</strong><strong> $ crontab -r</strong><br />
will remove (i.e. delete) your current crontab.<br />
<br />
Privileged users can also change other user's crontab with<strong><br />
root@</strong><strong>somehost</strong><strong> # crontab -u  <br />
</strong><br />
and then following it with either the name of a file to replace the <br />
existing user's crontab, or one of the -e, -l or -r options.<br />
<br />
According to the documentation the <em>crontab</em> command can be confused by the <br />
<em>su</em> command, so if you running a <em>su</em>'ed shell, then it is recommended you <br />
use the -u option anyway.<br />
<u><strong><br />
Controlling Access to cron</strong></u><br />
Cron has a built in feature of allowing you to specify who may, and who <br />
may not use it. It does this by the use of <em>/etc/cron.allow</em> and <em>/etc/cron.deny</em><br />
files. These files work the same way as the allow/deny files for other <br />
daemons do. To stop a user using cron, just put their name in cron.deny, to<br />
allow a user put their name in the cron.allow. If you wanted to prevent all<br />
users from using cron, you could add the line <em>ALL</em> to the cron.deny file:<strong><br />
<br />
root@</strong><strong>somehost</strong><strong> # echo ALL &gt;&gt;/etc/cron.deny</strong><br />
If you want user <strong>cog</strong> to be able to use cron, you would add the line <strong>cog</strong> <br />
to the cron.allow file:<strong><br />
root@</strong><strong>somehost</strong><strong> # echo cog &gt;&gt;/etc/cron.allow</strong><br />
<br />
If there is neither a cron.allow nor a cron.deny file, then the use of cron<br />
is unrestricted (i.e. every user can use it).  If you were to put the name of<br />
some users into the cron.allow file, without creating a cron.deny file, it<br />
would have the same effect as creating a cron.deny file with ALL in it.<br />
This means that any subsequent users that require cron access should be <br />
put in to the cron.allow file.  <u><strong><br />
<br />
Output from cron</strong></u><br />
As I've said before, the output from cron gets mailed to the owner of the<br />
process, or the person specified in the <em>MAILTO</em> variable, but what if you<br />
don't want that? If you want to mail the output to someone else, you can<br />
just pipe the output to the command <em>mail</em>.<br />
<br />
e.g<strong><br />
cmd | mail -s &quot;Subject of mail&quot; user</strong><br />
<br />
If you wish to mail the output to someone not located on the machine, in the<br />
above example, substitute <em>user</em> for the email address of the person who <br />
wishes to receive the output.<br />
<br />
If you have a command that is run often, and you don't want to be emailed <br />
the output every time, you can redirect the output to a log file (or <br />
<em>/dev/null</em>, if you really don't want the output).<br />
e,g<strong><br />
cmd &gt;&gt; log.file</strong><br />
<br />
Notice we're using two <em>&gt;</em> signs so that the output appends the log file and <br />
doesn't clobber previous output.<br />
The above example only redirects the standard output, not the standard error,<br />
if you want all output stored in the log file, this should do the trick.<strong><br />
cmd &gt;&gt; logfile 2&gt;&amp;1</strong><br />
<br />
You can then set up a cron job that mails you the contents of the file at<br />
specified time intervals, using the cmd:<strong><br />
mail -s &quot;logfile for cmd&quot; &lt;log.file<br />
